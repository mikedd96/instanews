INSTANEWS

Instanews is a minimalistic site for accessing news from the New York Times quick and easy. The stories are grabbed from New York Times api and shown on Instanews. It displays the New York Times logo to let you know where the stories are coming from, then a menu to allow you to narrow the reults to the category you are interested in. There are 12 news stories each with the associated image and story abstract to go along with it and the image is a click link that takes you to the full article on the New York Times own website. The page initially loads an aesthetically pleasing front that allows you to pick your category then the articles load and the page turns to the full site.
The website was created using HTML, CSS, Sass, ajax, gulp, lint,  and Javascript/JQuery. Instanews was created as project 02 for Red Academy.
